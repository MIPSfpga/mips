<p><big><b>1.  Introduction</b></big></p>

<p>In this lab a student reviews and synthesizes a configuration of MIPSfpga
system that contains a peripheral - Digilent Pmod ALS, the Ambient Light
Sensor. In order to integrate a new peripheral into MIPSfpga system, a
designer has to do three main steps:</p>

<ol>

<li>Design a Verilog module that handles the external protocol used to
communicate to the peripheral. The protocol used in this lab is Serial
Peripheral Interface (SPI).</li>

<li>Create glue logic used to interface the above module with AHB-Lite,
on-chip bus fabric, used in MIPSfpga system.</li>

<li>Write software support that allows the application program running on
MIPS microAptiv UP core inside MIPSfpga system to drive the peripheral using
the memory-mapped input/output registers.</li>

</ol>

<p>By going through this lab, a student also understands the fundamental
difference between on-chip buses (AHB, AXI, OCP) and inter-chip buses (SPI,
UART, I<sup>2</sup>C), as well as the difference between serial buses (SPI
bus used to communicate with the sensor is a kind if serial bus) and
parallel buses (AHB-Lite used in MIPSfpga SoC is a kind of parallel
bus).</p>

<p>The result of the light intensity, measured in this lab, is displayed on
multiple-digit seven-segment display. By combining a sensor, a system
controller and an output device (the display), the student constructs a
practically useful gadget, the light meter.</p>
